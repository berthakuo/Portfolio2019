                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>The DataHub project stemmed from leadership’s desire to bridge the numerous data silos across the MIT campus. They envisioned a centralized, web-based platform for the community to store, analyze and share data. The first iteration of DataHub was scoped to serve the Office of Sustainability, a new department on campus that was dependent on data managed by other departments. </p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>I was asked to conduct user research on MIT administrative staff that would be providing data for the Office of Sustainability. Specifically the team wanted to understand these departments’ end-to-end data workflows.</p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>In order to better understand how users did their data workflows, I decided to conduct in-person interviews with the request that the interviewees come prepared with a dataset they could walk us through in their own workspace and using their tools of choice. The goal was to see what they did in addition to what they said.

                <section>
                    <h3>1. Personas</h3>
                    <p>I created personas that encapsulated the needs, pain point and goals that I had heard during the interviews.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"> insert personas</p>
                </section>
                <!-- Revisit Initial Assumptions -->
                <section>
                    <h3>2. Revisit Initial Assumptions</h3>
                    <p>After creating the personas, I wanted to find a way in which they could be applied immediately. I decided to revisit the initial assumptions we had as a team about the project and see whether the personas refuted or validated them.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"> insert image</p>
                    <p>This was an interesting exercise because these assumptions weren’t explicitly stated anywhere; most internal documents focused on what the product would do (features) rather than the problem it was meant to solve.</p> 
                    <p>For example, the DataHub was envisioned as a bridge between those who had data and those that needed it.  However, existing bridges, created through back-and-forth conversations, often included additional information pertinent to understanding the dataset (e.g., a dataset’s meta-data). Was the DataHub meant to completely supplant those conversations and if so what meta-data would a dataset need to have in order to be able to exist independently of its owner?

                <section>
                    <h3>3. How Might We?</h3>
                    <p>I created personas that encapsulated the needs, pain point and goals that I had heard during the interviews.</p>
                    <p class="highlight"> insert image</p>
                    <p>The idea was to start with the pain point and use it to generate HMW questions that could lead to ideas and opportunities. The table above was a proposal for how this process might work and was meant as a jumping off point for the team rather than a final product since it’s efficacy would be dependent on the entire team’s participation. </p>
